## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* expo-cli
```sh
npm install expo-cli --global
```

### Installation

1. You need a firebase configuration file. Contact me to get a test configuration file. Without that config, firebase will not work.
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/anilsenay/Change-My-Mind.git
```
3. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```
4. Put your filebase.config.js file to src/consts/

5. Start the expo metro bundler
